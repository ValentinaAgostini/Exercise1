# Exercise1
Class FlatArray.java contains algorithm to generate a flat Integer Array from a generic Object Array as input.
Class FlatArrayTest.java contains a test suite for FlatArray.java.

Both respond to question:
Write some code that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].
